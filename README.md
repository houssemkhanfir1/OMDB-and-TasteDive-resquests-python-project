# OMDB and TasteDive requests

This project will take us through the process of mashing up data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations.<br> 
The TasteDive API lets us provide a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.)as a query input, and returns a set of related items.<br>
The OMDB API lets us provide a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review
sites (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.).<br>
# More details about building your program
We will put those two together. We will use TasteDive to get related movies for a whole list of titles. Weâ€™ll combine the resulting lists of related
movies, and sort them according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores (which will require making API calls to the OMDB API.).<br>
some functions are not available in full python environment.<br>
Us:- https://fopp.umsi.education/ to help you build your functions for this project.<br>
